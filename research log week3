In this week, we attempt to collaboatively compose a survey for gathering some data about technology use and needs.
I think that those activity help us infomr the project. 
After those activity, I learn we can not compose the survey too diffcult. Hence, composing the multiples choice is the best example.
If we Compose the survey to be the multiple choices, the audiences will be interesting to do it. 
Addition, we don't make the survey too much. If we make the survery too much, the audiences will lost their patience. 
As I begin the PierceHacker project, I have to know who is the particular audience for Pierce Hacker. I think audience for pierce Hacker is student. 
Doing everything must have the main code. I think the purpose of the PierceHacker project is opening pedagogy for student. 
As the writer the lead designer of the project I decided to deliver this work via the medium of a public website. 
There are two reasons why I decided to deliver this work via the medium of a pubilc website. 
One of reasons is doing the project in computer. The effect of the project will be better than the hand work. The audience will understand your project easier. 
Another reason is that more people will see the project on the public website than on the hand work. Nowadays, the most people using the internet for everyday.   
All in all, I learn how to compose the survey on the pubilc website.
